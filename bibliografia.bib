  abstract = {Researchers need to select high-quality research designs and communicate those designs clearly to readers. Both tasks are difficult. We provide a framework for formally "declaring" the analytically relevant features of a research design in a demonstrably complete manner, with applications to qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research. The approach to design declaration we describe requires defining a model of the world (M), an inquiry (I), a data strategy (D), and an answer strategy (A). Declaration of these features in code provides sufficient information for researchers and readers to use Monte Carlo techniques to diagnose properties such as power, bias, accuracy of qualitative causal inferences, and other "diagnosands." Ex ante declarations can be used to improve designs and facilitate preregistration, analysis, and reconciliation of intended and actual analyses. Ex post declarations are useful for describing, sharing, reanalyzing, and critiquing existing designs. We provide open-source software, DeclareDesign, to implement the proposed approach.}

But how many social science journals encourage or mandate that authors share the data supporting their research findings? How does the share of journal data policies vary by discipline? What influences these journals' decisions to adopt such policies and instructions? And what do those policies and instructions look like?We discuss the results of our analysis of the instructions and policies of 291 highly-ranked journals publishing social science research, where we studied the contents of journal data policies and instructions across 14 variables, such as when and how authors are asked to share their data, and what role journal ranking and age play in the existence and quality of data policies and instructions. We also compare our results to the results of other studies that have analyzed the policies of social science journals, although differences in the journals chosen and how each study defines what constitutes a data policy limit this comparison.We conclude that a little more than half of the journals in our study have data policies. A greater share of the economics journals have data policies and mandate sharing, followed by political science/international relations and psychology journals.Finally, we use our findings to make several recommendations: Policies should include the terms ``data,'' ``dataset'' or more specific terms that make it clear what to make available; policies should include the benefits of data sharing; journals, publishers, and associations need to collaborate more to clarify data policies; and policies should explicitly ask for qualitative data.},

  abstract = {Objective This study aims to systematically review all published quantitative studies examining the direct association between social capital and common mental disorders (CMD). Social capital has potential value for the promotion and prevention of CMD. The association between different types of social capital (individual cognitive and structural, and ecological cognitive and structural) and CMD must be explored to obtain conclusive evidence regarding the association, and to ascertain a direction of causality.
Design 10 electronic databases were searched to find studies examining the association between social capital and CMD published before July 2014. The effect estimates and sample sizes for each type of social capital were separately analysed for cross-sectional and cohort studies. From 1857 studies retrieved, 39 were selected for inclusion: 31 cross-sectional and 8 cohort studies. 39 effect estimates were found for individual level cognitive, 31 for individual level structural, 9 for ecological level cognitive and 11 for ecological level structural social capital.
Main results This review provides evidence that individual cognitive social capital is protective against developing CMD. Ecological cognitive social capital is also associated with reduced risk of CMD, though the included studies were cross-sectional. For structural social capital there was overall no association at either the individual or ecological levels. Two cross-sectional studies found that in low-income settings, a mother's participation in civic activities is associated with an increased risk of CMD.
Conclusions There is now sufficient evidence to design and evaluate individual and ecological cognitive social capital interventions to promote mental well-being and prevent CMD.},

Sociologists, however, have been largely absent from these discussions. The goals of this review are to introduce sociologists to these developments, synthesize insights from science studies about replication in general, and detail the specific issues regarding replication that occur in sociology. The first half of the article argues that a sociologically sophisticated understanding of replication must address both the ways that replication rules and conventions evolved within an epistemic culture and how those cultures are shaped by specific research challenges. The second half outlines the four main dimensions of replicability in quantitative sociology\textemdash verifiability, robustness, repeatability, and generalizability\textemdash and discusses the specific ambiguities of interpretation that can arise in each. We conclude by advocating some commonsense changes to promote replication while acknowledging the epistemic diversity of our field.},

Psychology journals are the principal adopters, but expansion has begun into medicine, social science, and other fields. Among 29 journals that responded to a survey, 334 protocols had been submitted to them, 87 had been granted IPA and 32 Final Reports had been published or were in press as of July 2017.

One such initiative is preregistration of quantitative research. We investigate whether the preregistration format could also be used to boost the credibility of qualitative research. A crucial distinction underlying preregistration is that between prediction and postdiction. In qualitative research data is used to decide which way interpretation should move forward, using data to generate hypotheses and new research questions. Qualitative research is thus a real-life example of postdiction research. Some may object to the idea of preregistering qualitative studies because qualitative research generally does not test hypotheses, and because qualitative research design is typically flexible and subjective. We rebut these objections, arguing that making hypotheses explicit is just one feature of preregistration, that flexibility can be tracked using preregistration and that preregistration would provide a check on subjectivity. We then contextualise preregistrations alongside another initiative to enhance credibility in qualitative research: the confirmability audit. Besides, preregistering qualitative studies is practically useful to combating dissemination bias and could incentivise qualitative researchers to report the constant development of their study. We conclude with some suggested modifications to the Open Science Framework preregistration form to tailor it for qualitative studies.},

Methods We identified all large NHLBI supported RCTs between 1970 and 2012 evaluating drugs or dietary supplements for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disease. Trials were included if direct costs {$>\$$}500,000/year, participants were adult humans, and the primary outcome was cardiovascular risk, disease or death. The 55 trials meeting these criteria were coded for whether they were published prior to or after the year 2000, whether they registered in clinicaltrials.gov prior to publication, used active or placebo comparator, and whether or not the trial had industry co-sponsorship. We tabulated whether the study reported a positive, negative, or null result on the primary outcome variable and for total mortality. Results 17 of 30 studies (57\%) published prior to 2000 showed a significant benefit of intervention on the primary outcome in comparison to only 2 among the 25 (8\%) trials published after 2000 ({$\chi$}2=12.2,df= 1, p=0.0005). There has been no change in the proportion of trials that compared treatment to placebo versus active comparator. Industry co-sponsorship was unrelated to the probability of reporting a significant benefit. Pre-registration in clinical trials.gov was strongly associated with the trend toward null findings. Conclusions The number NHLBI trials reporting positive results declined after the year 2000. Prospective declaration of outcomes in RCTs, and the adoption of transparent reporting standards, as required by clinicaltrials.gov, may have contributed to the trend toward null findings.},

Dado el espacio acotado de este volumen, no se abunda en experiencias hist\'oricas espec\'ificas, pero se intenta dilucidar si es posible llegar a una concepci\'on de lo que es el populismo para las ciencias sociales.El autor busca evitar que populismo se confunda con l\'ogica pol\'itica en general. Por eso recurre a especificar lo propio de la l\'ogica pol\'itica populista en ciertas condiciones de recepci\'on del discurso populista. La consecuencia de todo esto es que desaparece la idea de que existe un viejo populismo y un nuevo populismo de naturaleza diferente. Tambi\'en desaparece la idea de que el populismo es, necesariamente, de derecha o izquierda, socialista o capitalista, democr\'atico o totalitario. El populismo se construye, no est\'a predeterminado. Pero al mismo tiempo queda claro que hay otros modos de movilizaci\'on pol\'itica no populista.Por ejemplo, si bien puede existir una v\'ia populista al socialismo, hay tambi\'en otras formas de articulaci\'on de las demandas populares que construyen un sujeto pueblo en una perspectiva no populista. La Unidad Popular es el mejor ejemplo. Con esto se deja tambi\'en muy clara la relaci\'on entre movimiento social y populismo.},

PAPs promote transparency and credibility by helping readers distinguish between exploratory and confirmatory analyses. However, PAPs are time-consuming to write and may fail to anticipate contingencies that arise in the course of data collection. This article proposes the use of ``standard operating procedures'' (SOPs)\textemdash default practices to guide decisions when issues arise that were not anticipated in the PAP. We offer an example of an SOP that can be adapted by other researchers seeking a safety net to support their PAPs.},

Class relations are defined as relations of domination and economic interest distribution. A class framework composed of 16 class positions is constructed in terms of authority or market capacity in dual domination. The seven-class scheme generated by aggregation of the 16 class positions fits well with a four-cluster model estimated with latent class analysis of the 2010 CGSS, suggesting that the proposed framework is empirically relevant. The statistical findings also show that, compared to advanced industrialized societies, China has a larger proportion of command classes, a relatively equal share of new and old middle classes, and a smaller working class. China has significantly more farmers, especially in the central and western regions. The class structure is olive-shaped in the eastern region but ``圭'' (gui)-shaped in the central and western regions. The proposed class scheme can significantly predict income inequality, supporting the argument that class relations have the character of a ``domination-interest duality.''},

  abstract = {Objectives: Based on a life course perspective, we assessed the association between three types of social advantages and disadvantages accumulated across different life stages, with the number of self-reported chronic conditions among women aged 60 + in Chile, a Latin-American country with almost no reports on this matter.

Methods: We used a population-representative longitudinal survey (Chile's Social Protection Survey) with information about childhood conditions, economic mobility across life, educational attainment, late adulthood labor-force trajectories, and later-life health, of 2627 women aged 60+. We then used sequence and Poisson regression analyses to assess the effect of life course (dis)advantages over the number of chronic conditions in old age.

Results: Growing up in a poor household and experiencing downward economic mobility (especially among those with a non-poor childhood) increases the predicted number of chronic conditions in old age. By contrast, having a continuous and formal labor-force trajectory in late adulthood and higher educational attainment is associated with fewer chronic conditions later in life.

Conclusions: Policy measures that seek to foster health prevention and health care among older women should consider how multiple exposures to social advantages/disadvantages during earlier stages of the life course could affect health in late life.},

This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes\textemdash a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

Consistently using one term across disciplines to refer to the concept of study registration may improve the understanding and uptake of this practice, thereby supporting the movement toward improving the reliability and reproducibility of research through study registration.

Additionally, we also conducted a comparability analysis of risk factors across 17 studies. We found evidence supporting a total of 60 predictors for disease severity, of which seven were deemed of high consistency, 40 of medium and 13 of low. Among the factors with high consistency of association, we found age, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, albumin, body temperature, SOFA score and diabetes. The results suggest that diabetes might be the most consistent comorbidity predicting disease severity and that future research should carefully consider the comparability of reporting cases, factors, and outcomes along the different stages of the natural history of covid-19.},

Thus, synthesizing previous works, it is argued that the crisis of Chilean advanced neoliberalism finds its causes in the incubation of the neoliberal turn itself, which reaches almost five decades, and that transforms the economic model and forms of business accumulation, as well as the set of social structure and the prevailing pattern of social conflict. In short, an accumulation of social and cultural contradictions different from those of Chilean society of the last century, which today feed new social and political problems},

Objects of discovery can be things, events,processes, causes, and properties as well as theories and hypothesesand their features (their explanatory power, for example). Mostphilosophical discussions of scientific discoveries focus on thegeneration of new hypotheses that fit or explain given data sets orallow for the derivation of testable consequences. Philosophicaldiscussions of scientific discovery have been intricate and complexbecause the term ``discovery'' has been used in manydifferent ways, both to refer to the outcome and to the procedure ofinquiry. In the narrowest sense, the term ``discovery''refers to the purported ``eureka moment'' of having a newinsight. In the broadest sense, ``discovery'' is a synonymfor ``successful scientific endeavor'' tout court. Somephilosophical disputes about the nature of scientific discoveryreflect these terminological variations., Philosophical issues related to scientific discovery arise about thenature of human creativity, specifically about whether the``eureka moment'' can be analyzed and about whether thereare rules (algorithms, guidelines, or heuristics) according to whichsuch a novel insight can be brought about. Philosophical issues alsoarise about rational heuristics, about the characteristics ofhypotheses worthy of articulation and testing, and, on the meta-level,about the nature and scope of philosophical reflection itself. Thisessay describes the emergence and development of the philosophicalproblem of scientific discovery, surveys different philosophicalapproaches to understanding scientific discovery, and presents themeta-philosophical problems surrounding the debates.},

While recently much of this work has been dismissed, the appearance of more radical social movements and the ongoing crisis of neoliberalism suggest that it still has much to tell us. In this respect, this article seeks to readdress the writing of the historian E. P. Thompson, arguing that his work on the class-based and other social movements, poetics, critique of positivism and economic reason, utopia and the idea of the commons all have much to offer more contemporary scholarship. While the article recognises that the cultural Marxism of figures like Thompson cannot simply be resurrected, it does continue to offer a number of critical insights. By readdressing the internal complexity of Thompson?s writing, the argumentative strategy of this article suggests that cultural sociology needs to move beyond more simplistic understandings of cultural Marxism and more carefully explore what it has to offer. This is especially pressing in a world that after the financial crash of 2008 has become increasingly dominated by the values and practices of capitalism. In this respect, Thompson?s contribution to cultural sociology is to offer a more complex language of resistance and transformation than exists within other less class-based traditions of sociology.},

Treatment success was evaluated by comparing the microbiological status of duplicate pretreatment quarter milk samples collected at drying off with the microbiological status of duplicate quarter milk samples collected four to ten days postcalving. Infection status of 1318 cows in 75 herds in five geographic locations was determined. Treatment effects on infected cows were evaluated by least squares analysis of variance with treatment, herd, lactation number, days dry and milk production at drying off considered as variables. The dose of 400 mg novobiocin per quarter was demonstrated to be significantly more effective (P {$<$} 0.05) than no drug and significantly better than (P {$<$} 0.05) or equal to the other doses for curing infections caused by S. aureus, S. agalactiae and other streptococci. A significant reduction (P {$<$} 0.05) in the overall rate of new udder infections acquired during the dry period was observed in cows treated with {$>$}/= 200 mg novobiocin at drying off. The data supported the conclusion that the cow rather than the quarter is the appropriate experimental unit in the evaluation of intramammary mastitis treatments. Herd and lactation number were the most significant variables affecting cures.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the connection between neoliberalism and the capitalist classes in Argentina and Chile. In particular, it investigates the legacies of neoliberal reform for capitalist class formation, asking why capitalists were able to achieve a hegemonic class position through reform in Chile though not in Argentina.Albeit many historical commonalities, market reforms ended up producing di erent outcomes and reactions: a tempered neoliberalism in Chile that have only recently been contested, and a post-neoliberal backlash in Argentina in the wake of the 2001 crisis.These divergent paths are related with the outcome of market reforms and various other factors, including the capacity of businessmen to restore political and class power. The ideological cohesion, political in uence, and symbolic power of the Argentinean and Chilean business classes are contrasted. I conclude by discussing the relationships between capitalist classes' power and their capacity to resist collectivist attempts to undo marketization.},

  abstract = {Media convergence and growing financial pressure on the journalistic field have triggered significant changes in newsmaking cultures across the world. This article examines the challenges of media convergence in the newsroom of Valor Econ\^omico, the main economic newspaper in Brazil. In particular, it explores how the introduction in 2013 of Valor Pro, a real time news service oriented to the financial market, changed newsmaking practices at Valor Econ\^omico. The introduction of Valor Pro meant that journalists from the whole newsroom had to report news simultaneously for three platforms: the real time service, the online website and the printed paper. This shift not only intensified journalists? workloads and altered the manufacture of news, but also increased financial pressure on the paper?s agenda. I argue that this shift ? from producing news for the public towards producing news for the market ? cannot be explained solely with reference to traditional political economic factors such as ideological decisions at editorial level and the structural properties of the Brazilian media sphere. Instead, drawing on resources from cultural sociology and from science and technology studies, I provide a richer explanation that acknowledges the impact of technological innovation, the shifting nature of news values, and the agency of journalists themselves. This article elaborates on seven months of ethnographic fieldwork in Valor Econ\^omico?s newsroom in S?o Paulo between 2013 and 2015 and contributes to the literature on cultural sociology, media studies and science and technology studies.},
